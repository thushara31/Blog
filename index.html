        <p class="text-muted">Great experience. The tank with the whale sharks was immense and they had a viewing window
          that I was told was 63 feet long and looked at least 25 feet high. This is as close as you can get to scuba
          diving without getting wet. The animals looked well taken care of. I did a shark and ray encounter and it was
          fun and educational. This is a definite must if you are anywhere neat Atlanta Georgia. One caution, all of the
          encounters book up early, so book your encounter well in advance. Also, the shows have limited seating. You
          have to register for the shows when you get there in order to get in. </p>

        <p class="text-muted">I have been coming to Camelback for nearly a decade now- it’s always a fun time on the mountain with friends. The trails are long and well maintained, and the lifts are nice. Staff interactions have always been awesome, even in the face of some very rude cliental. It’s clear the staff (esp at the rental desk and ski patrol ) work hard.

          That said - Camelback loses points on mismanaged lines, customer service, poor quality ( and expensive ) food and the audacity to charge for parking on top of an already very expensive day.
          
          They also went to some ridiculous RFID system where there is no one there to manage people getting on lifts, until you get to the actual lift. You have to pull out this little card ( hard to do all geared up) to scan to get through the equivalent of a metal detector- so in essence you que to Que- and society isnt set up for this to run smoothly - at all. Lines for lifts were approx 20 min yesterday. Granted it was a holiday week- maybe limit the passes you sell if all trails aren’t open?
          
          Please bring back scannable paper lift tickets - orange coats and a price scanners seem to do a better job of hurdling the masses
          
          This review is based on our experience Wed Dec 28. - 2.5 hours in guest services, $500 between the two of us for lift tickets , parking and rental to go on 6 runs. It was a fun day , but may be going to a resort off the beaten path in the future.
          
          Some tips- buy your passes online (ahead of your arrival, because there’s little cell phone service when it’s that crowded), bring your own gear or rent gear off mountain - there are several spots in the area, and bring your own food or wait to apres at a restaurant like Kimche and Wasabi. If you can’t buy your passes ahead of time make sure you have enough friends to wait in both lines simultaneously.
          
          Bottom line- pack your patience and realize , like everything else, the pandemic has raised costs and lowered quality and expectations. </p>

    <p>
      "The House with Clocks in its Walls" was a more than pleasant surprise! The story, neatly adapted from John Bellair's novel by Eric Kripke, is playful and compelling. There is suspense, comedy, family sentiment, valuable life-lessons (most notably: it's okay to be different), and the special effects are top-notch. I never was much of a Jack Black fan, but he's tolerable here, and he's formidably supported by Cate Blanchett and Kyle McLachan. With this film, Eli Roth demonstrates that he evolved a lot since "Cabin Fever", and that he's capable of more than repulsive torture-horror.</p>
